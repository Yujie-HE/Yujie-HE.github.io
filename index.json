The high efficiency of correlation filter (CF) based trackers has advanced the widespread development of online UAV object tracking. This kind of method can effectively train a filter to discriminate the target from the background. However, most CF-based methods require a fixed label function over all the previous samples, leading to over-fitting and filter degradation, especially in complex drone scenarios. To address this problem, a novel adaptive response reasoning approach is proposed for CF learning. It can leverage temporal information in filter training and significantly promote the robustness of the tracker. Specifically, the proposed response reasoning method goes beyond the standard response consistency requirement and constructs an auxiliary label of the current sample. Besides, it helps learn a generic relationship between the previous and current filters, thereby realizing self-regulated filter updating and enhancing the discriminability of the filter. Extensive experiments on four wellknown challenging UAV tracking benchmarks with 278 videos sequences show that the presented method yields superior results to 40 state-of-the-art trackers with real-time performance on a single CPU, which is suitable for UAV online tracking missions.","tags":["Real-time UAV tracking","Discriminative correlation filter","Adaptive response reasoning","Featured"],"title":"ReCF: Exploiting Response Reasoning for Correlation Filters in Real-Time UAV Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Semester Research Student at Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS), EPFL since Feb. 2021 Supervisor: Valentin Wüest (PhD student), Dr. Przemyslaw Mariusz Kornatowski, and Prof. Dario Floreano\n Table of Contents HAHAHUGOSHORTCODE-TOC0-HBHB\nBackground At the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS), passionate researchers are developing a human-friendly drone delivery system for last-cm delivery - Dronistics.

To this end, we propose MULLS, an efficient, low-drift, and versatile 3D LiDAR SLAM system. For the front-end, roughly classified feature points (ground, facade, pillar, beam, etc.) are extracted from each frame using dual-threshold ground filtering and principal components analysis. Then the registration between the current frame and the local submap is accomplished efficiently by the proposed multi-metric linear least square iterative closest point algorithm. Point-to-point (plane, line) error metrics within each point class are jointly optimized with a linear approximation to estimate the ego-motion.  Static feature points of the registered frame are appended into the local map to keep it updated. For the back-end, hierarchical pose graph optimization is conducted among regularly stored history submaps to reduce the drift resulting from dead reckoning. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets with more than 100,000 frames collected by six types of LiDAR on various outdoor and indoor scenarios. On the KITTI benchmark, MULLS ranks among the top LiDAR-only SLAM systems with real-time performance.","tags":["LiDAR","Autonomous driving","Linear least square","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Featured"],"title":"MULLS: Versatile LiDAR SLAM via Multi-metric Linear Least Square","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changhong Fu","Junjie Ye","Juntao Xu","Yujie He","Fuling Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"![BiCF_comp](featured.png) Comparison between discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and the proposed BiCF  ### Reference If you find this project is useful, you may cite it as: ```tex @article{Lin2020TCSVT, title={{Learning Temporary Block-Based Bidirectional Incongruity-Aware Correlation Filters for Efficient UAV Object Tracking}}, author={Lin, Fuling and Fu, Changhong and He, Yujie and Guo, Fuyu and Tang, Qian}, booktitle={IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology}, pages={1-14}, year={2020} } ``` -- ","date":1602028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602028800,"objectID":"299526b79eb37f225827520901764903","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/publication/2020-ibri-tgrs/","publishdate":"2020-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-ibri-tgrs/","section":"publication","summary":"Aerial object tracking approaches based on discriminative correlation filter (DCF) have attracted wide attention in the tracking community due to their impressive progress recently. Many studies introduce temporal regularization into the DCF-based framework to achieve a more robust appearance model and further enhance the tracking performance. However, existing temporal regularization approaches usually utilize the information of two consecutive frames, which are not robust enough due to limited information. Although some methods attempt to incorporate abundant training samples and generally improve the tracking performance, these improvements are at the expense of significantly increased computing consumption. Besides, most existing methods introduce historical information directly without denoising, which means background noises are also introduced into the filter training and may degrade the tracking accuracy. To tackle the drawbacks mentioned above, this work proposes a novel aerial object tracking approach to exploit disruptor-aware interval-based response inconsistency, i.e., IBRI tracker. The proposed method is able to incorporate historical interval information by utilizing responses in the filter training process, thereby obtaining a robust tracking performance while maintaining the real-time speed. Moreover, to reduce the disruptions caused by similar object, partial occlusion, and other challenging scenes, a novel disruptor-aware scheme based on response bucketing is introduced to detect the disruptor and enforce a spatial penalty for the disruptive area around the tracked object. Exhausted experiments on multiple well-known challenging aerial tracking benchmarks demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed IBRI tracker against other 35 state-of-the-art trackers. With a real-time speed of ~32 frames per second on a single CPU, the proposed approach can be applied for typical aerial platforms to achieve aerial visual object tracking efficiently.","tags":["Aerial object tracking","Discriminative correlation filter","Interval-based response inconsistency","Disruptor-aware bucketing"],"title":"Disruptor-Aware Interval-Based Response Inconsistency for Correlation Filters in Real-Time Aerial Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fuling Lin","Changhong Fu","Yujie He","Fuyu Guo","Qian Tang"],"categories":null,"content":" ![BiCF_comp](featured.png) Comparison between discriminative correlation filter (DCF) and the proposed BiCF  -- Reference If you find this project is useful, you may cite it as:\n@article{Lin2020TCSVT, title={{Learning Temporary Block-Based Bidirectional Incongruity-Aware Correlation Filters for Efficient UAV Object Tracking}}, author={Lin, Fuling and Fu, Changhong and He, Yujie and Guo, Fuyu and Tang, Qian}, booktitle={IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology}, pages={1-14}, year={2020} }  ","date":1599782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782400,"objectID":"3b9988aa77574382216f4b32b3877f70","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/publication/2020-tbbicf-tcsvt/","publishdate":"2020-09-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-tbbicf-tcsvt/","section":"publication","summary":"In the field of UAV object tracking, correlation filter based approaches have received lots of attention due to their computational efficiency. The methods learn filters by the ridge regression and generate response maps to distinguish the specified target from the background. An ideal filter can predict the object’s position in a new frame, and in turn, can backtrack the object in the past frames. However, the neglect of tracking reversibility in most methods limits the potential of using inter-frame information to improve performance. In this work, a novel bidirectional incongruity-aware correlation filter is presented based on the nature of tracking reversibility. The proposed method incorporates the response-based bidirectional incongruity, which represents the gap between the filters’ discriminative difference in the forward and backward tracking perspective caused by object appearance changes. It enables the filter not only to inherit the discriminability from previous filters but also to enhance the generalization capability to unpredictable appearance variations in upcoming frames. Moreover, a temporary block-based strategy is introduced to empower the filter accommodate more drastic object appearance changes and make more effective use of inter-frame information. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three challenging UAV tracking benchmarks, including UAV123@10fps, DTB70, and UAVDT. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has superior performance compared with the other 34 state-of-the-art trackers. Our approach permits real-time performance at ~46.8 FPS on a single CPU and is suitable for UAV online tracking applications.","tags":["Aerial video analysis","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Visual object tracking","Discriminative correlation filter","Temporary block-based bidirectional incongruity"],"title":"Learning Temporary Block-Based Bidirectional Incongruity-Aware Correlation Filters for Efficient UAV Object Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujie He","Changhong Fu","Fuling Lin","Yiming Li","Peng Lu"],"categories":null,"content":" Comparison between baseline KCC tracker and the proposed TACF tracker -- Videos  Presentation  \n \n Tracking results demo  \n \nReference If you find this project is useful, you may cite it as:\n@inproceedings{He2020IROS, title={{Towards Robust Visual Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with Tri-Attentional Correlation Filters}}, author={He, Yujie and Fu, Changhong and Lin, Fuling and Li, Yiming and Lu, Peng}, booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)}, year={2020}, pages={1575-1582} }  ","date":1599004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599004800,"objectID":"47a2a3b4e72a5eb5b1a9a8d684e77efb","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/publication/2020_tacf_iros/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_tacf_iros/","section":"publication","summary":"Object tracking has been broadly applied in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks in recent years. However, existing algorithms still face difficulties such as partial occlusion, clutter background, and other challenging visual factors. Inspired by the cutting-edge attention mechanisms, a novel object tracking framework is proposed to leverage multi-level visual attention. Three primary attention, i.e., contextual attention, dimensional attention, and spatiotemporal attention, are integrated into the training and detection stages of correlation filter-based tracking pipeline. Therefore, the proposed tracker is equipped with robust discriminative power against challenging factors while maintaining high operational efficiency in UAV scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on two well-known benchmarks with 173 challenging UAV video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposed tracking algorithm favorably outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods, yielding 4.8% relative gain in UAVDT and 8.2% relative gain in UAV123@10fps against the baseline tracker while operating at the speed of ∼28 frames per second.","tags":["Visual tracking","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Attention mechanisms","Featured"],"title":"Towards Robust Visual Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with Tri-Attentional Correlation Filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Undergraduate Research Assistant since Sep. 2018\n Table of Contents HAHAHUGOSHORTCODE-TOC0-HBHB\nOverview Investigated correlation filter (CF)-based visual object tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles.

During the UAV tracking process, viewpoint variations are usually accompanied by changes in the object and background appearance, which poses a unique challenge to CF-based trackers. Since the appearance is gradually changing over time, an ideal tracker can not only forward predict the object position but also backtrack to locate its position in the previous frame. There exist errors in the reversibility of the tracking process, which contains the information on the changes in appearance. However, some existing methods do not consider the forward and backward errors while using only the current training sample to learn the ﬁlter. For other ones, the applicants of considerable historical training samples impose a computational burden on the UAV. In this work, a novel bidirectional incongruity-aware correlation ﬁlter, i.e., BiCF tracker, is proposed. By integrating the bidirectional incongruity error into the CF, BiCF can efﬁciently learn the changes in appearance and suppress the inconsistent error. Extensive experiments on 243 challenging image sequences from three UAV datasets (i.e., UAV123, UAVDT, and DTB70) are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed BiCF tracker favorably outperforms other 25 state-of-the-art trackers and achieves a real-time speed of 45.4 FPS on a single CPU, which can be applied in UAV efﬁciently.","tags":["Visual tracking","Unmanned aerial vehicles"],"title":"BiCF: Learning Bidirectional Incongruity-Aware Correlation Filter for Efficient UAV Object Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Final project for TJ-100685 深度学习 | Deep learning, Sep. 2019 - Jan. 2020\n  Utilized the latest Weight Standardization}** (WS) as well as GroupNorm to accelerate neural networks training from scratch for 3D Zonal Segmentation of the Prostate MRI images.\n Conducted extensive evaluation between the proposed UWG-Net with the baseline with small batch sizes, achieving 2-3\\% increase in multi-class segmentation accuracy for medical imaging application.\n  For more info, you can refer to this page !\n","date":1578355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578355200,"objectID":"c0a3faf6ff114a1520a3feced6e21559","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/project/2019-dl-mip/","publishdate":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2019-dl-mip/","section":"project","summary":"Implemented 3D Segmentation on medical images and got A in deep learning elective course.","tags":["Machine Vision","Deep Learning","Finished😊"],"title":"3D Zonal Segmentation of the Prostate MRI (Deep Learning Final Project)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Changhong Fu","Yujie He","Fuling Lin","Weijiang Xiong"],"categories":null,"content":" \nMain structure of the proposed tracking approach\n\nReference If you find this project is useful, you may cite it as:\n@article{Fu2020NCAA, title={{Robust Multi-Kernelized Correlators for UAV Tracking with Adaptive Context Analysis and Dynamic Weighted Filters}}, author={Fu, Changhong and He, Yujie and Lin, Fuling and Xiong, Weijiang}, journal={Neural Computing and Applications}, pages={1-17}, year={2020} }  ","date":1575504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575504000,"objectID":"3a099303b9e3dae061a1cf46fc4af39e","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/publication/2020_mkct_ncaa/","publishdate":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_mkct_ncaa/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, the correlation filter (CF)-based method has significantly advanced in the tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As the core component of most trackers, CF is a discriminative classifier to distinguish the object from the surrounding environment. However, the poor representation of the object and lack of contextual information have restricted the tracker to gain better performance. In this work, a robust framework with multi-kernelized correlators is proposed to improve robustness and accuracy simultaneously. Both convolutional features extracted from the neural network and handcrafted features are employed to enhance expressions for object appearances. Then, the adaptive context analysis strategy helps filters to effectively learn the surrounding information by introducing context patches with the GMSD index. In the training stage, multiple dynamic filters with time-attenuated factors are introduced to avoid tracking failure caused by dramatic appearance changes. The response maps corresponding to different features are finally fused before the novel resolution enhancement operation to increase distinguishing capability. As a result, the optimization problem is reformulated, and a closed-form solution for the proposed framework can be obtained in the kernel space. Extensive experiments on 100 challenging UAV tracking sequences demonstrate the proposed tracker outperforms other 23 state-of-the-art trackers and can effectively handle unexpected appearance variations under the complex and constantly changing working conditions.","tags":["Visual tracking","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Multi-kernelized correlators","Adaptive context analysis","Dynamic weighted filters","Featured"],"title":"Robust Multi-Kernelized Correlators for UAV Tracking with Adaptive Context Analysis and Dynamic Weighted Filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s my first time to participate the top robotics conference\u0026ndash;IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2019) held on Nov. 4 – 8, 2019 in Macau, China.\nFeel very lucky to talk to the experts, professors, and my fellows!\nOur paper \u0026lsquo;Sample Purification-Aware Correlation Filters for UAV Tracking with Cooperative Deep Features\u0026rsquo; is accepted by the Workshop on Fast Neural Perception and Learning for Intelligent Vehicles and Robotics and won the Best Poster Award!\nFor more details, please refer to SPCF!\n\nMy first time to attend top robotics conference, IROS @ Macau\n\nKeynote by *Davide Scaramuzza* covering Autonomous Drones Event Cameras  -- ","date":1572840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572840000,"objectID":"b06a9c527d705b63f1d8f86cf734ca2c","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/post/19-11-iros/","publishdate":"2019-11-04T12:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/19-11-iros/","section":"post","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s my first time to participate the top robotics conference\u0026ndash;IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2019) held on Nov. 4 – 8, 2019 in Macau, China.\nFeel very lucky to talk to the experts, professors, and my fellows!\nOur paper \u0026lsquo;Sample Purification-Aware Correlation Filters for UAV Tracking with Cooperative Deep Features\u0026rsquo; is accepted by the Workshop on Fast Neural Perception and Learning for Intelligent Vehicles and Robotics and won the Best Poster Award!","tags":["conference","IROS"],"title":"2019-11-04: Our paper SPCF won the Best Poster Award in the IROS Workshop, Macua, China.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Changhong Fu","Fuling Lin","Fan Li","Yujie He"],"categories":null,"content":"\nComparison between traditional CF-based and proposed SPCF tracker\n\n","date":1567209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567209600,"objectID":"885aa35a9654e3a8444e0e183be373c5","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/publication/2019_spcf_irosw/","publishdate":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_spcf_irosw/","section":"publication","summary":"Correlation Filters (CF) have recently demonstrated promising performance in terms of rapidly tracking objects for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in different types of UAV tracking tasks. The strength of the approach comes from its ability to learn how the object is changing over time efficiently. However, due to heavy dependence on the quality of the training set and the lack of real negative training samples, the object appearance model may be easily interfered by the corrupted training samples, which can result in suboptimal performance. Besides, limited by the representation of a single feature, the tracking model may fail to cope with the complex surrounding environment and considerable appearance variation of the object. In this work, the principal causes behind the problems of the abundance of object representation and purity of training samples have been tackled, to simultaneously improve both discriminative power and anti-disturbance capability of the tracking model. Comprehensive experiments on 100 challenging UAV image sequences have demonstrated that the novel sample purifying tracker based on cooperative features learning, i.e., SPCF tracker, outperforms 15 state-of-the-art trackers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and accuracy.
